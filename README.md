# Web Scraper
<p> Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website.
Web scraping is not illegal but it is important to be ethical and respect the rules of thes site.
</p>
<p> In this project we have done webscraping for 'quotes.toscrape.com'.
10 pages of this site have been scraped and saved into a .csv file.
The data can be saved in a .csv/.json/.xml file and further exploratory data analysis can be done on the scraped data.
</p>
<p> This is the site from where data is being scraped.</p>
